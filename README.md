Spearal iOS Sample Application
==============================

A sample iPhone application based on SpearalIOS / Spring MVC / JPA2.

## How to run the demo?

Clone (recursively) this repository:

````bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/spearal-examples/spearal-example-ios.git
````

Start XCode 6.1 (other versions may not work) and open the `spearal-example-ios/spearal-example-ios.xcworkspace` file. You can then run the demo by clicking on the top-left arrow of the workspace window (make sure the "SpearalIOSExample" target is selected).
